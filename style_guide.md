# Style Guide

Please follow the guidelines stated here when contributing to this repository.

## Spacing

- Always use tabs. Spaces suck.
- Avoid trailing spaces at the end of lines.
- Avoid trailing empty lines at the end of files.
- Surround operators with a single space (except for when using `=` in parameter lists).
- Leave two empty lines between functions outside of a class.
- Leave one empty line between functions inside of a class.
- Leave one empty line between logical blocks of code in the same function.

## Naming

- Use `snake_case` for files, folders, and variables.
- Use `PascalCase` for classes.
- Use `kebab-case` for branch names.

## Quotes

- Use double quotes.

## Auto Formatting

If you want your IDE to help you format your code, search how to set up your IDE to use the `black` formatter. If at any point it asks you to run this command:

```
pip install black
```

run this one instead:

```
pip install black-with-tabs
```
