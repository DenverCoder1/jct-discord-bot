# Contribution Guide

Please follow the instructions on this guide when making contributions to the JCT Discord Bot.

## First Time Contributor

The first time you contribute to this project, feel free to add your name under the list of contributors in the [README.md](https://github.com/DenverCoder1/jct-discord-bot/blob/main/README.md) file. You can include this change along with the pull request you make.

## Contributing

### 1 - Creating an Issue

When making a contribution, whether to fix a bug, or to add a new feature, first **create an issue** if it doesn't already exist, outlining briefly what needs to be accomplished. (Note each issue has an issue number by which we will reference it later on.)

Once the issue exists, **add any appropriate labels**, then add it to the project **JCT Discord Bot**. (This can be accomplished on the issue's page on GitHub, on the right hand side on desktop, or at the bottom on mobile.) Then you can **assign yourself** to the issue.

### 2 - Creating a Branch

Create a branch for the contribution you are making. If it is a new command you want to add, simply name the branch the same as the command (without the command prefix). If it is a bug you want to fix or something else, come up with some descriptive yet concise name for the branch.

### 3 - Writing the Code

Now you can write your code to implement your feature. You can commit and push to the dedicated branch as often and whenever you like.

Always use tabs. Spaces suck.

[//]: # "TODO: Explain how to organise each new feature in a separate file."

### 4 - Testing your Code

[//]: # "TODO: Explain how to test the bot locally."

### 5 - Creating a Pull Request

Once you have tested your feature and you think it is ready to be deployed, you can go ahead and **create a pull request** on GitHub to merge your branch to the Main branch.

Start the description of the pull request with the line `Close #N` (where `N` is the number of the issue) in order to link the pull request with the corresponding issue. (This can also be done manually after the PR is created, but it's preferable if you do it this way.)

Once the pull request is made, or while creating it, **add a reviewer** to your pull request. They will review your changes and additions, and if they approve, they will merge your pull request.
